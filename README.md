# KIT-2400024 Deep Learning and Neuronal Networks Lecture Materials
Welcome to my personal repository for managing code related to the Deep Learning and AI lecture!

## Overview

This repository contains materials and code for the lecture sessions on Deep Learning and Neuronal Networks. Each notebook corresponds to a practical session and each session covered multiple topics.

## Contents

### DLNN_SS2024_Praktikum1

- **Creating Perceptron Using NumPy**: Understand the basics of neural networks by implementing a perceptron.
- **Creating MLP from Scratch Using NumPy**: Dive deeper into neural network architecture and operations by building a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch.
- **Creating MLP Using TensorFlow Functional API**: Learn how to create an MLP using TensorFlow's functional API, a popular deep learning framework.
- **Building Model on IRIS Dataset Using TensorFlow Functional API**: Apply your knowledge to a real-world dataset (IRIS) for classification tasks using TensorFlow's functional API.

### DLNN_SS2024_Praktikum2
- **Creating Transformer Model Using TensorFlow**: Understand the architecture and components of the Transformer model, a popular deep learning model for sequence-to-sequence tasks.
- **Creating Transformer Model Using TensorFlow (Continued)**: Continue building the Transformer model and train it on a real-world dataset (WMT14 English-German translation dataset).
- **Creating Transformer Model Using TensorFlow (Continued)**: Further explore the Transformer model by adding positional encoding and masking to improve its performance.

### DLNN_SS2024_Praktikum3
- **Meta learning**: Understand the concept of meta-learning and its applications in deep learning.
- 

### DLNN_SS2024_Praktikum4
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Learn about knowledge distillation, a technique for transferring knowledge from a large model to a smaller model.

### DLNN_SS2024_Praktikum5
- **Large Language Models**: Explore large language models such as GPT-2 and GPT-3 and their applications in natural language processing tasks.

### DLNN_SS2024_Praktikum6
- **Adversarial Attacks and Defenses**: Understand adversarial attacks and defenses in deep learning models.
