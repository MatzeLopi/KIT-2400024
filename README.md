# KIT-2400024 Deep Learning and Neuronal Networks Lecture Materials
Welcome to my personal repository for managing code related to the Deep Learning and AI lecture!

## Overview

This repository contains materials and code for the lecture sessions on Deep Learning and Neuronal Networks. Each notebook corresponds to a practical session and each session covered multiple topics.

## Contents

### DLNN_SS2024_Praktikum1

- **Creating Perceptron Using NumPy**: Understand the basics of neural networks by implementing a perceptron.
- **Creating MLP from Scratch Using NumPy**: Dive deeper into neural network architecture and operations by building a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch.
- **Creating MLP Using TensorFlow Functional API**: Learn how to create an MLP using TensorFlow's functional API, a popular deep learning framework.
- **Building Model on IRIS Dataset Using TensorFlow Functional API**: Apply your knowledge to a real-world dataset (IRIS) for classification tasks using TensorFlow's functional API.

## Usage

To explore the lecture materials and code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory corresponding to the practical session you're interested in.
3. Open the notebook(s) using Jupyter or any compatible notebook viewer.
4. Follow the instructions and code examples provided in the notebook.
5. Experiment with the code, modify parameters, and explore different concepts to deepen your understanding.
